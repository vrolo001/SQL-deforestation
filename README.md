# SQL-deforestation
SQL-based project where I conduct a series of operations on World Bank forestation data, including:
- joining tables to create one comprehensive view of the data
- grouping, filtering, and using CTEs to create new views at the regional and country levels
- using nested queries
- categorising counties into quartiles based on forest percentage using CASE WHEN
- computing arithmetic operations
